# HelloWorldDeployment Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool.

## Building and Running the HelloWorldDeployment Application

In order to build the HelloWorldDeployment application, or any other FÂ´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```
cd HelloWorldDeployment
fprime-util generate
```

The next step is to build the HelloWorldDeployment application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
cd HelloWorldDeployment
fprime-gds
```

To run the ground system without starting the HelloWorldDeployment app:
```
cd HelloWorldDeployment
fprime-gds --no-app
```

The application binary may then be run independently from the created 'bin' directory.

```
cd HelloWorldDeployment/build-artifacts/<platform>/bin/
./HelloWorldDeployment -a 127.0.0.1 -p 50000
```
